 Our Volunteer Interaction Programme is open to anyone over the age of 16. No specific qualifications are required – just commitment and consistency. All prospective volunteers must attend an orientation session at the Centre. This includes a presentation to give information about the Centre, followed by a guided tour, where you will see our classrooms and other units in action and meet some of our staff and students.
